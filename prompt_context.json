  "text": "About the Author\nAfter graduating from Stanford \nUniversity in 2001, Tony Flores \nquickly found himself broke and \njobless. Up to his ears in student \nloans, he got a job in sales with a \nnatural health company. It was then \n– when the company owner handed \nhim a Jay Abraham book – that he was \nfirst introduced to direct marketing. \nFrom there, he discovered the \nprocess of copywriting. This new skill \nwas a lifesaver for him, and it wasn’t \nlong before Tony had used what he \nwas learning to double the sales of his \ncompany, taking a two-man operation \nto just under $3 million in annual \nsales.  \nAt that point, he sent a business \nidea to copywriting legend Clayton \nMakepeace, who hired him on \nthe spot. Since that time, Tony \nhas developed the industry’s most \nacclaimed newsletter on copywriting \n… has created a series of powerful \ndirect marketing educational products \n… and has written winning direct \nresponse promotions in a variety of \nmarkets. Tony currently resides in Los \nAngeles, CA.\nClayton Makepeace and \nThe Total Package Present:\nEMOTIONAL\nTRIGGER WORDS\nby\nTony Flores\n© 2009 by The Profit Center™\nAll rights reserved.  \nReproduction, in whole or in part,  \nwithout written permission  \nfrom the publisher \n is strictly prohibited.\nEmotional Trigger Words™ is a publication of:\nThe Profit Center™\nPO Box 750 \nWaynesville, NC 28786\nPh: (800) 827-0940\nIntl: (828) 456-9277\nwww.MakepeaceTotalPackage.com\n\n 3\nIntroduction \nby Tony Flores\nThe underlying emotional triggers that grab a prospect’s attention, keep his eyes glued to the \npage … and then ultimately compel him to make a purchase decision are often unknown to even the \nmost experienced copywriters.\nMany of the copywriting greats use the power of emotions very instinctively, which works for \nthem. But I’ve found that this “instinct only” knowledge makes it virtually impossible for these \nmasters to teach people like you and me all the subtleties of emotional copywriting.\nThat’s why this book was created — it’s for the rest of us! \nIt’s for us “regular” writers and marketers who weren’t born knowing exactly how to stimulate \nour prospect’s hottest emotions, at exactly the right moments. It’s almost unfair how great writers can \nhone in on the exact emotions they need to make the sale, and then continually hit those emotional \nhot buttons six ways to Sunday. \nBut now it’s time to level the playing field.\nThe manual you now hold in your hands is the ultimate secret weapon. Even if you’re a complete \nemotional dunce (like I am), you can’t help but become a much more visceral, emotionally-potent \ncopywriter with this in your arsenal. \nAnd by “emotional copywriter,” I don’t mean that you experience mood swings throughout the \nworkday or cry when you think about your deadlines.  \nNope. I’m talking about becoming the kind of writer who:\n■ Knows exactly which emotional hot buttons to hit and when …\n■ Knows exactly how to trigger each emotion for maximum impact …\n■ NEVER writes boring copy, because every line on your page oozes with feeling and passion …\n■ Stands head and shoulders over others who rely on benefits alone to make the sale …\n■ Can stop a prospect on a dime, with an eyeball-seizing emotional headline and then keep that \npowerful feeling rocking and rolling throughout the promotion …\n■ Ultimately jumps to the upper echelon of this business, because he’s mastered perhaps the single \nmost elusive and valuable skill a copywriter could ever have …\nYou see, over the past three years I’ve literally devoured every single piece of good copywriting/\ndirect response information I could get my hands on. Most of it has been pretty straightforward: \nCatch your prospect’s attention with your headline, focus on benefits, make an irresistible offer, \njustify the cost, ask for the sale, and so on. But in all of this material, “how to” info on using \nemotions was truly rare indeed.\nSure everybody tells you that emotions are powerful … Sure everybody tells you that the right \nemotions will make you tons of money … Sure everybody tells you that people buy on emotions and \njustify with logic/reason … That’s all fine and dandy. \nBut there’s just one problem …\n\n    4\n… Nobody Tells You How to Actually DO It!\nYou see, I never found anyone who could give writers like me and you a concrete, super-practical \nblueprint that guides you to putting exactly the right emotional words and phrases into your copy \n— every time. \nRemember, this book is absolutely NOT about vague and difficult to master exercises like … \n“becoming your prospect” … or imagining his “core complex” … or even conjuring up a some kind \nof picture of his feelings in your mind’s eye.\nNot at all! Instead, we wanted to make this process absolutely foolproof. That’s why we’ve \nalso included tactical secrets for each emotion in the section proceeding the actual words. In those \nsections, we carefully lay out the conditions that make it much, MUCH easier to spot the emotional \ntriggers in almost any possible situation. Because once you know that, inserting the words that follow \nis a piece of cake.  \nAlso, a note of warning: You might wonder why almost every word and sentence in this book \ncomes from the health and investment market. It’s simple. That’s where nearly all the best writers \nhave focused their attention over the last 20-30 years. And wanting to only take words and sentences \nfrom the crème de la crème — from the highest paid, most successful copywriters in the world — I \ndecided to pull everything from controls in those markets. \nDon’t worry. Even if you write and market in a different industry all together, this stuff is \nuniversal. The same emotional patterns exist across market and industry lines — and the same \nemotional triggers apply. As you’ll soon see, the market doesn’t change the fundamental words and \npatterns. Fear is fear, greed is greed, and urgency is urgency — no matter what market you’re in! \n And as a marketer, copywriter or even possibly a business owner — ALL you really need \nto know is: (a) the variety of emotions used effectively in sales and marketing … (b) how these \nemotions relate to purchase decisions … and (c) which words will effectively trigger them for \nmaximum response.\nIf you can do that right, you’re well on your way to fame and fortune as a marketer, copywriter, \nsalesperson, entrepreneur … ANYONE whose success depends on selling products or services via      \ndirect response.\n\n\n 5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1 How to Use This Resource................................................................................. 6\n2 Words that Get Your Prospect’s Blood Boiling (Anger) .................................... 9\n3 The National Enquirer’s All-Time Hottest Emotion (Betrayal) ...................... 12\n4 Don’t Get Mad … Get EVEN (Revenge) ........................................................ 15\n5 Scary Words that Grab Your Prospect\n and Force Him to Keep Reading (Fear) .......................................................... 17\n6 You’re Not Supposed to Be Seeing This But … (Forbidden) ......................... 24\n7 When You’re Sick and Tired\n of Being Sick and Tired (Frustration)............................................................. 27\n8 “Greed is good.

This has \nbeen especially eye-opening — with \nmuch of what I’m presenting here the \ndirect outcome of what I discovered in \ndissecting Clayton’s biggest winners.\nConsequently, what I’ve done \nin this book is incredibly synergistic \nwith everything Clayton teaches. In \ngoing through his copy, I found the \nstrongest and most commonly targeted \nemotions. I busted my brain figuring \nout exactly when and where he (and \nother great writers) use these emotions \nto further the sales process; and which \nwords they use to do that.   \nThen I grouped and organized \nthe words in each distinct emotional \nsection, paying special attention to \nhow that emotion is used in winning \ncopy.\nPut simply, this stuff works. Not \nonce, not twice … but over and over \nagain. I’ve personally seen Clayton \nuse and teach everything in this \nbook. These are some of the exact \nsame secrets his copy cubs have \nused to become six and seven-figure \ncopywriters in short order. \nAnd that includes yours truly. \nDespite just breaking onto the \nscene, I’ve personally used all of \nthese techniques in the battlefield — \nespecially in the time that I’ve spent \nconsulting and writing promotions \ndirectly with Clayton. So I can assure \nyou; they work like gangbusters \nacross the board — for rookies, \nveterans, superstars and everyone in \nbetween. \nWhy You’ll Have a Blast Using \nthese Explosive Little Words\nOnce you get going, this process \ncan be so fun! As a writer and \nmarketer, you know how fantastic it \nfeels to get passionate about a subject \n— feeling the same level of emotion \nas your prospect is feeling — whether \nit’s a drug scandal, a supplement \nconspiracy, a Wall Street scam or \nanything else. \nAnd you know how amazing it \nfeels when you can come to the point \nwhere you’re able to put that feeling \ninto words for him, so that he instantly \nidentifies with the message you’re \narticulating in the copy. \nOf course, that’s not always so \neasy. You’ve got to actually KNOW \nwhat your prospect’s feeling — first!\nTake anger, for example. To really \nuse anger to the max, you’ll want to \nbegin by presenting some sort of fact, \nevent, claim or subject you’re sure will \narouse your prospect’s anger. \nAnd how do you find that out? \nResearch, of course! You study the \ndaylights out of your prospect — his \nhopes, dreams, desires, beliefs and \nmore. And more importantly, you \nlook at the relationship between your \nprospect and your product, the market, \nthe subject of the information you’re \ngiving him — anything for which he \ncould possibly be angry.\nAnd don’t forget: With the \ninformation at the beginning of \neach chapter you’ll learn to quickly \nrecognize when an emotion has a \nhigh likelihood of being present in \nyour prospect. No guarantees here — \nemotions are extremely fickle things. \nBut masters like Clayton and others \nhave learned to spot such conditions \nand take full advantage of them for \nmuch higher percentages of success \nthan most other writers.\nTo do likewise, you simply flip to \nthe section on anger and discover why \nanger arises, and how it’s most often \nused in direct response. This will give \nyou a strong psychological foundation \nthat eventually will become second \nnature to you.  \nAfter that, you look within that \nsame chapter for words that you \nnow know are proven to effectively \ntrigger that emotion. Tune into that \nHow to Use This \nResource\nOne of the biggest benefits you’ll \nfind from using this book is that you \nstart to think  … see  … and FEEL \nall of these powerful emotions at \nwork. Do this enough and a whole \nnew world starts to open up. You \nbegin to understand human nature \nand motivation on a far deeper level. \nAs a result, you’re able to predict, \ndirect and harness the power of your \nprospects’ desires … because emotions \nhave and always will be the most \neffective way to do just that.\nI believe the best marketers and \ncopywriters in the world, the true \nmasters like Clayton Makepeace, Gary \nBencivenga, Gene Schwartz, Jim Rutz, \nJohn Carlton and many others, have \na deeply instinctive understanding of \nhow these human emotions work. \nThey’ve learned how to position \ntheir products or services (and the \npeople behind the products or services) \nas powerful emotional solutions to \nreal-life problems of their prospects. \nSolutions that gave their prospects \nas much emotional satisfaction and \nvindication as they got from whatever \nmaterial good they purchased. \nSo how do you do this?\nThe first step is always to find \nout your prospects’ dominant resident \nemotions regarding the subject at \nhand, just as Clayton teaches. By \ndominant resident emotion, he means \nthe primary (i.e. most dominant) \nemotion that sticks around for a long \ntime (i.e. resident). These are feelings \nlike the fear of loss, the hatred for \ninjustice, the yearning for hope and \nlove, and so many more.\nHe covers this extensively in \nmany issues of The Total Package, his \nteleseminars and How to Challenge \na Strong Control product, the \nEasy Writers Marketing Club, his              \ngroundbreaking Power Marketing \nSummit, and will do so in The Ultimate \nDesktop Copy Coach. This is where \nI learned a good percentage of his \nteachings on emotion in sales copy. \n1\n\n7\nfeeling you think your prospect is \nexperiencing and then write your copy \nusing as many of these words as you \npossibly can. Doing this guarantees \nyou’ll have much more of this emotion \nin your copy than before! It’s that easy.\nKeep in mind, however, that one \nemotion — like anger alone — won’t \never be enough. That’s a mistake \nbeginning writers make all the time \nwith any of the “negative” emotions; \nthinking that making the prospect \nangry or afraid will always help move \nthe sale forward. Not true.\nAny emotion you stimulate needs \nto be actionable — and in a way that \nmakes your prospect want to take \naction toward your offer. You can \nalways make your prospect angry or \nafraid of something. That’s easy. But it \nwon’t necessarily make him want your \nproduct or service any more. \nSo as you begin your research \nprocess and start to walk in your \nprospect’s shoes, the most powerful \nemotions you can stimulate will \nalways be the ones that predispose him \nto act on your offer. I would read that \nlast sentence again. Let me repeat it \nfor you: The most powerful emotions \nyou can stimulate will always be the \nones that predispose your prospect to \nact on your offer. \nFor example, if you’re writing \nan investment piece on China, you \nmay choose to simulate his fear about \nlosing money and about how the \ncountry is being slowly destroyed on \nan economic level. Then you’ll want \nto couple this with his emotional \ndesire to make more money and feel \npatriotic. \nNow you’ve got a variety of \nactionable emotions working for you, \nand your job is simply to convince \nyour prospect that he can solve them \nall by sending in for your risk-free, \ntrial offer.\nEven More Practical  \nWays to Make This Book Work\nOnce you’ve successfully targeted \nthe right dominant emotions in your \nprospect, then it’s a matter of picking \nout the words that have been used \nto trigger this emotion in winning \npromotions  … and learning from the \nexample sentence taken out of real \ncontrol mailings.\nThis should get your juices \nflowing. In fact, as you contemplate \nyour prospect’s feelings and read \nthrough this list, certain words will \nliterally JUMP OUT at you!\nBe sure to jot them down as \npossibilities for your headline, deck \ncopy, your lead or other critical areas \nof your promotion. \nAlso remember that emotions are \nvery fluid and difficult to fit in a tight \nbox. Science is only now beginning to \nactually study them with technology. \nWhich means that words in each \nsection are NOT 100% limited to that \nspecific emotion. Words that trigger \nfeelings of fear in your prospect might \nalso trigger anger, betrayal, shame or \nothers. \nOverall, I’ve created this system \nsimply to match up the words top \ncopywriters have typically (and \nsuccessfully) used to trigger certain \nemotions. You’ll find that they’re \npretty accurate. And as a result, if you \nload up your copy with words from \na certain section — your copy WILL \ncarry that feeling. \nAnd, of course, the more \nexperience you get with these ultra-\npowerful words, the better you’ll get at \nselecting exactly the right one for your \nneeds. \nA Quick Glimpse at How It \nLooks In Action\nWith a little practice, you’ll \nbe able to dramatically boost the \nemotional potency of your copy. And \nyou’ll do it with just these words. \nBelow is an example from a \nwildly successful financial promotion \nClayton wrote that’s loaded with \nwords that trigger “fear.” I’ve bolded \nthe main ones. Read through it and \nnotice the visceral impact each one \ncreates: \n“Just when you thought \nit was safe to get back \ninto stocks — all of the \neconomic ghosts of all \nthe financial crises of \nthe past 30 years are \nreturning to shock Wall \nStreet once again!\nAs investors, you and \nI have been through a \nlot in recent years: \nWe’ve witnessed the Tech \nWreck of 2000 … the \nDebt Disaster of 1998 … \nand the Asian Crisis of \n1997.\nAnd don’t forget how \nstocks got slammed by \nthe Energy Crisis of the \n1970’s … the Real Estate \nBust of 1974 … the Bond \nMarket Collapse of 1979-\n80 … the Banking/S&L \nDebacle of the 1980s … \nand when the Gulf War \ndrove oil prices through \nthe roof. \nEach one of these crises \ngutted investment values \n— and each one vaporized \nthe prosperity, the \nfinancial security, and \nthe retirement dreams of \nmillions.\nNow these economic \nnightmares are once \nagain rearing their ugly \nheads. Even worse: all 7 \nare rapidly converging \non the U.S. economy \n— and in the next few \nmonths, they will \nsimultaneously slam into \nWall Street, triggering \nthe most painful \neconomic collapse since \n1929.” \nDon’t you see and FEEL their \nimpact? It’s a big part of why this \nlead hooked Clayton’s prospects, and \nbrought in a truly MASSIVE number \nof new customers for Weiss Research. \nIn direct response, results never lie. \nThis example is just a taste of \nwhat you’ll find in the fear section. \nClayton literally has over 100 words \nChapter 1:  How to Use this Resource\n\n8 Emotional Trigger Words\njust for “fear” alone, whereas if \nyou look at many of the fear-driven \nfinancial promotions in the mail \n— you’ll see 10-20, TOPS. And \nremember — because I went through \ntons and tons of his own controls \n— just about every emotional word he \nknows is in this book! \nNow just imagine what you’ll be \nable to do with your own promotions \nwhen you have easy access to nearly \n1,500 proven emotional words and \nphrases. Many of which are even \nstronger than the ones bolded above. \nWords that instantly trigger  … the \nshocking feeling of betrayal  … the \nthirst for revenge  … the jolt of a \nconspiracy  … the ecstasy of regaining \nyour health  … and much, MUCH \nMORE.\nTying Multiple Emotions  \nTogether in an Effective \nSequence\nYou’ll also discover that many \nemotions are very closely related \nto each other. When someone is \nafraid, he feels powerless. After a \ncertain amount of time spent feeling \npowerless, your prospect may develop \na deep and growing frustration and \nseek out a solution that gives him \nhope. He’ll want to feel passionate and \nhappy about conquering these limiting, \nnegative feelings.\nSimilarly, if he feels the intense \nfear of loss, destruction, collapse \nor humiliation — presenting an \nopportunity to profit (the emotion of \ngreed) will often help soothe these \nfeelings. \nLikewise, security is an antidote \nto fear. Investors or health patients \nthat are afraid of something want to \nfeel secure — they want those fearful, \nuncertain feelings to fade away. So \non a tactical level, you’ll build up the \nfear using “fear” words — and then \nyou’ll offer a solution to the fear by \nconnecting your product to language \nthat brings about the feeling of \nsecurity. \nAnd here’s another example: Let’s \nsay that your prospect is afraid of \nnot having enough money, of going \nbroke, of being poor. This is a VERY \ncommon fear. What do you see in \nthe most proactive people with this \nspecific fear? They’re proactively \ngreedy about making the amount of \nmoney that will wipe away that feeling \nof fear. Some may be more driven than \nothers to gain money and conquer the \nfear of being poor — but the structure \nis exactly the same. They also seek \nways to feel safe and secure about \ntheir money, however that can be \naccomplished. \nAs a copywriter, you need to \nunderstand emotional patterns like \nthis and set up situations — just like \nClayton does — where one emotion is \npushing your prospect and another is \npulling him. In the example above, the \nprospect is being pushed by the fear of \nloss (he’s moving away from it) and \nbeing pulled in by the greed of gain \n(he’s moving toward it). Each emotion \nworks together, multiplying each \nother’s power and effectiveness. \nJust look at a prospect in the \nhealth market. He is being pushed \nby (and wants to move away from) \na variety of negative emotions  \n— the fear of losing his life  … the \nshame and humiliation of chronic, \ndebilitating disease … the frustration \nof trying all kinds of natural solutions \nand having none of them really work \n… the anger and betrayal he feels \nregarding doctors who treat him like a \nwalking statistic … the list goes on.\nThen at the same time he’s got the \nmore positive, desirable emotions like \nhope, happiness, security, love and \nmore. He desperately hopes his body \nwill be able to heal naturally from the \nailments that afflict him … he seeks \nthe unique happiness that comes from \nboundless energy and good health \n… he wants the security of knowing \nhe’ll be there (with a fully functioning \nbody) for his wife and kids day in and \nday out … he seeks to increase and \nshare his love for family by taking \ncare of his health … and much more. \nPlus, he’s willing to work and \ngo after things that help him feel \nthese positive emotions — whether \nit’s powerful health information, a \nsupplement, a brand new therapy or \nanything else. This is because they \nnot only help him get what he wants \nand dreams, but also because they \nhelp him get away from the negative, \nreactive emotions that he’s struggling \nwith all the time. \nBottom line: When you combine \nthe “push” of the negative emotions \nwith the “pull” of the positive ones, \nyour copy becomes a force to be \nreckoned with!\nNow let’s start learning all of the \ndifferent emotions that will make you \na not-so-small fortune in the weeks, \nmonths and years to come.\n\n9\nWords that Get     \nY our Prospect’s \nBlood Boiling …\nAnger is a very powerful and often \nunder-used emotion in copywriting. But \nremember, there’s a distinct difference \nbetween actionable, USEFUL anger and \nuseless anger that doesn’t help you a lick \nin making the sale. \nTo use anger effectively and really \nmake it actionable, you need to create a \ntarget. You’ll want to present somebody \nor something for your prospect to get \nangry at (i.e. an enemy). This enemy isn’t \nthe end solution, but it prepares him to \ntake action.  \nThat sets the stage for you to position \nyour product or service as the solution \n— you’ll help him soothe his anger, and \nstart to experience the more positive \nfeelings he desires. And in certain cases, \nas we’ll see in the next two sections, you \nmay even be able to give him ways to \navenge his losses (through the emotion of \nrevenge), turn the tables on his oppressive \nenemy, and more.\nTo get into the feeling of anger \nand develop the ability to sincerely \nstimulate it, first understand the common \npatterns you see in sales and marketing. \nAnger almost always follows a problem \nof injustice, unfairness or unmet \nexpectations. \nFor example, your prospect expects \ndoctors to care about his health, his life \nand his well being. But so often they \ndon’t!\nAnd THAT’S grounds for anger. \nThink about the last time you got angry \nat somebody and you’ll see that this is \ntrue. Maybe it was somebody on the road \nwho cut you off (and you were angered \nbecause he violated your sense of driving \nfairness and justice). Or perhaps it was \nthat your son or daughter lied about doing \ntheir homework (because it goes against \nwhat you think should have happened \n— your expectations weren’t met). \nSo the root cause of anger is any kind \nof violation of your prospect’s sense of \njustice — the way he thinks things should \nbe. When you understand this, you’ll \nmore readily spot other opportunities to \ntrigger this emotion. ANY time somebody \nhas expectations that are not being met, \nany time there’s a difference between \nwhat’s fair and what’s actually happening \n— there’s almost undoubtedly going to be \nanger present.\nThink about the investment market. \nBrokers, CEOs, Wall Street advisors and \nother people in positions of authority \nwho claim to exist — and promote \nthemselves as existing — for the purpose \nof making your prospect’s life easier, \nmore profitable, of helping to protect and \ngrow his existing money, for warning him \nof impending danger, etc. But that’s not \nalways the case! Many people in these \npositions abuse him, lie to him, take \nhis money and ruin his financial future. \nThis is the opposite of what he expects, \nit’s unfair and it makes him justifiably \nfurious.\nAnd you’ll find a similar pattern in \nthe health market. \nIn fact, let’s look at an example …\nThe medical world is at war \nwith itself. And frankly, if \neither side wins, you lose. \nForgive me for being blunt \n— but for your sake, I just \nhave to get this off my  \nchest …\nDoctors and other medical \nexperts who preach, “all you \nneed is drugs” — who claim \nthat nutritional supplements \nare worthless — are a hazard \nto your health! \nAs we’ve already seen, even \ndrug companies admit that \ntaking prescription drugs and \neven seemingly harmless over-\nthe-counter remedies leaves \nyou vulnerable to serious \nnutrient deficiencies — and \nthe deficiency diseases they \ncause. \nListen to these extremists, \nand you’ll wind up taking \neven more drugs for every \nside effect — a deadly spiral \nthat only leads you to \ndisaster. \nMeanwhile, these extremists \nstubbornly ignore many \nnatural remedies that \nhave been proven to be as \neffective and in some cases, \neven more effective than \ncostly, hazardous drugs! \nI’ve even had a case where \ndoctors refused to listen \nwhen I recommended CoQ10 — a \nsubstance that could have \nsaved a patient’s life — they \nrecommended “pulling the \nplug” instead!\nNotice the angry tone in this example. \nThe editor — in this case Dr. Sinatra — is \nventing on his prospect’s behalf over \ninjustices that could be costing him is \nhealth … or even his life! \nSo anytime you want to use anger, \nlook for situations like this where the \nprospect isn’t being treated like he feels \nhe should. If you can find instances of \nunfairness or injustice — jot down that \nanger as a dominant emotion. Then you \nsimply create an opportunity (via your \nproduct or service) to release that anger \nand fulfill the other positive emotions your \nprospect is seeking. Let him know you can \nTRULY deliver the desirable feelings that \nothers have been unable to do. \nDo that and you’re GOLDEN. \nSome more examples? If you’re in \nthe water filter business and everybody’s \nmaking claims that are confusing your \nprospect, costing him money, stealing \nhealth benefits, continually frustrating \nhim — you begin by defining and \npersonalizing the enemy. Maybe it’s \nthe large bottled water companies that \nare marking up their products 1800% \n… pulling the old “switcheroo” and \nputting tap water into their product … \nnot removing all of the chlorine and \ncontaminants, thereby risking his health \n… or anything else. \nOnce you decide, you make it tangible \nfor your prospect by building up and proving \nthe corruption of the enemy until he’s likely \nto feel genuine anger over these lies and \ninjustices.\nThen you position your product and \nspokesperson as the opposite — someone \nwho really delivers on the promises that \neveryone else is making and lying about. \nIn this water filter example, it could mean \nproving that your product is very fairly \npriced and will save your prospect many \nthousands over his lifetime … that your \nproduct removes every single contaminant \n2\nChapter 2:  Words that Get Your Prospect’s Blood Boiling … (Anger)\nAnger\n\n10 Emotional Trigger Words\nBureaucrats – “The bureaucrats’ ‘perfect \ncrime’ means you’ll soon need a prescription \nto buy your favorite vitamins!” \nCheat – “In 2003, investors will discover \nthat nearly ALL major stock brokerages \n– the heart and core of Wall Street – lied, \ncheated and robbed them blind.”\nCocky – “And in early 2002, cocky brokers \nnearly laughed themselves silly when I \nwarned that the high and mighty of Wall \nStreet were about to be exposed as liars, \ncheats and thieves.”\nCrap – “If you’re like me, you have little \ntolerance for crap in any area of your life. \nSo why should that be any different when it \ncomes to your health?” \nCriminal – “ … the Wall Street Under-\nground has been the only publication in the \nworld with the guts to expose the greatest \ncriminal conspiracy of our time  …”\nCrooked – “PLUS, the investments that \nwill soar 99%  … 144%  … up to 307% \nas these crooked brokers get what they \nDESERVE!”\nCruel – “REVEALED INSIDE – The \nCruelest Accounting Scandal EVER!”\nDamned – “Lies … Damned Lies … and \nGOVERNMENT STATISTICS.”\nDirtiest – “Washington’s dirt\n\n[... документ обрезан ...]",
